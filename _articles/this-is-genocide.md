## Definition

### Core Legal Definition: UN Genocide Convention (1948)

**Article II — Definition**

Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group:

1. Killing members of the group  
2. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group  
3. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part  
4. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group  
5. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group  

To legally constitute genocide, two essential elements must be proven:

- **Actus Reus (the act itself):** one or more of the acts listed above.  
- **Mens Rea (intent):** a specific intent to destroy the protected group “as such,” in whole or in part.
