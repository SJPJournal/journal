# About Us

We are a coalition of students, educators, and community members standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine. Through education, advocacy, and action, we seek to raise awareness about ongoing injustices, amplify Palestinian voices, and mobilize for human rights and liberation.

# Our Objectives

Our movement is rooted in principles of justice, equality, and solidarity. We aim to:

1. Educate our campuses and communities about the history and reality of Palestinian life under occupation.
2. Advocate for accountability and an end to policies that sustain oppression and displacement.
3. Support global calls for freedom, dignity, and self-determination for the Palestinian people.
4. Build cross-movement solidarity among struggles for liberation, decolonization, and justice everywhere.

## Education

We publish articles to foster critical understanding of Palestinian history, international law, and the structures of power that shape the region today.

## Advocacy

We work to shift campus and community policies toward ethical engagement—pressuring institutions to divest from companies complicit in occupation and to uphold human rights standards in all partnerships.

## Community Solidarity

We believe in people-powered change. By connecting with local and global allies, we build networks of care, resistance, and resilience that strengthen movements for freedom.

> — _Malcolm X_

> “Lastly, I speak out in indignation as I think of the Palestinians, whom this most inhuman humanity has replaced with another people … the valiant Palestinian people, the families which have been splintered and split up and are wandering throughout the world seeking asylum.”

> — _Martin Luther King Jr._

## Our Vision

We envision a future grounded in justice, equality, and coexistence—where all people, regardless of race, faith, or nationality, can live in dignity and peace.  
Our work continues until Palestine is free.
